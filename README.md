- 👋 Hi, I’m Kole. A Filipinx-American living in Taiwan.
- 👀 I've worn a lot of hats, from Marine Biologist to EFL Teacher, and love integrating my diverse experiences into current endeavors.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on the WiDS 2024 Datathon to continue upskilling.
- 💞️ I'm hoping to breakout into a data engineer or data analyst role in 2024 - if you're looking or have leads, feel free to contact me!
